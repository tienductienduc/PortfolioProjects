I have a foundational understanding of SQL, enabling me to write queries for data extraction and basic manipulation. While Iâ€™m still expanding my skills, I can perform tasks such as writing some complex queries to join tables, filter datasets, and perform aggregations, allowing me to derive actionable insights from medium, to large datasets. I'm eager to enhance my SQL expertise further to support data-driven decision-making.
