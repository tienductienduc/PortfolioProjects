I have a foundational understanding of SQL, enabling me to write queries for data extraction and basic manipulation. While I’m still expanding my skills, I can perform tasks such as writing some complex queries to join tables, filter datasets, and perform aggregations, allowing me to derive actionable insights from medium, to large datasets. I'm eager to enhance my SQL expertise further to support data-driven decision-making.

**Direct: Covid Project**

- **Goal:** To analyze global COVID-19 trends from 2019 to 2024 by examining cases, deaths, and vaccination data across countries and continents. This project aims to provide insights into the pandemic's impact over time, geographic hotspots, and vaccination progress.

- **Description:** This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), exporting data, and visualizing the findings in Tableau. Using SQL Server, I processed the dataset—which contains cases, deaths, vaccination rates, population, and regional information—to analyze infection and mortality trends, vaccination coverage, and population impact.

- **Skills:** Converting Data Types, Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views.

- **Technology:** SQL Server

- **Results:** Key findings include identifying countries and continents with the highest infection and mortality rates, understanding the timeline of infection surges, and assessing vaccination coverage by region. This analysis highlights data-driven insights into COVID-19 trends globally and regionally, valuable for understanding patterns of response and recovery, all of this data will be visualised in Tableau project below.
