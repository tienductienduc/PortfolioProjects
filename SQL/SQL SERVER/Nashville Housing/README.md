I have a foundational understanding of SQL, enabling me to write queries for data extraction and basic manipulation. While Iâ€™m still expanding my skills, I can perform tasks such as writing some complex queries to join tables, filter datasets, and perform aggregations, allowing me to derive actionable insights from medium, to large datasets. I'm eager to enhance my SQL expertise further to support data-driven decision-making.

**Direct: Nashville Housing Project**

- **Goal:** To prepare the Nashville Housing dataset for analysis by performing thorough data cleaning, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all records.

- **Description:** In this project, I focused on the data cleaning process for the dataset. The cleaning steps involved standardizing the data formats, converting the SaleDate to the correct date format, separating the Address into individual components, filling in null and blank values using data from corresponding rows, and removing any duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.

- **Skills:** Converting Data Types, SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, CASE WHEN, Joins, CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions.

- **Technology:** SQL Server

- **Results:** The cleaned dataset is now ready for analysis, providing a reliable foundation for future exploratory data analysis and insights into Nashville's housing market. This cleaning process enhances data quality and ensures that any subsequent analyses will be based on accurate and consistent information.
