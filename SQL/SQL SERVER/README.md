I have a foundational understanding of SQL, enabling me to write queries for data extraction and basic manipulation. While I’m still expanding my skills, I can perform tasks such as writing some complex queries to join tables, filter datasets, and perform aggregations, allowing me to derive actionable insights from medium, to large datasets. I'm eager to enhance my SQL expertise further to support data-driven decision-making.

**Direct:** [Covid Project](https://github.com/tienductienduc/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/SQL/SQL%20SERVER/Covid)

- **Goal:** To analyze global COVID-19 trends from 2019 to 2024 by examining cases, deaths, and vaccination data across countries and continents. This project aims to provide insights into the pandemic's impact over time, geographic hotspots, and vaccination progress.

- **Description:** This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), exporting data, and visualizing the findings in Tableau. Using SQL Server, I processed the dataset—which contains cases, deaths, vaccination rates, population, and regional information—to analyze infection and mortality trends, vaccination coverage, and population impact.

- **Skills:** Converting Data Types, Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views.

- **Technology:** SQL Server

- **Results:** Key findings include identifying countries and continents with the highest infection and mortality rates, understanding the timeline of infection surges, and assessing vaccination coverage by region. This analysis highlights data-driven insights into COVID-19 trends globally and regionally, valuable for understanding patterns of response and recovery, all of this data will be visualised in Tableau project below.

**Direct:** [World Layoffs Project](https://github.com/tienductienduc/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/SQL/SQL%20SERVER/Layoffs)

- **Goal:** To analyze global layoffs trends from March 2020 to March 2023 across various industries and countries. The project aims to identify patterns in layoffs over time, impacted industries, and countries with the highest layoff rates.

- **Description:** This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using SQL Server, I processed a dataset containing company details, layoff dates, total laid-off employees, layoff percentages, industry types, and country information to explore layoff trends over time and across sectors.

- **Skills:** Converting Data Types, Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views.

- **Technology:** SQL Server

- **Results:** Key insights reveal which countries and industries were most impacted by layoffs, peak layoff periods, and company-specific layoff rates. This analysis provides a data-driven understanding of global workforce reductions during this period, highlighting sectors and regions most affected by economic challenges.

----------------------------------
**Direct:** [Nashville Housing Project](https://github.com/tienductienduc/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/SQL/SQL%20SERVER/Nashville%20Housing)

- **Goal:** To prepare the Nashville Housing dataset for analysis by performing thorough data cleaning, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all records.

- **Description:** In this project, I focused on the data cleaning process for the dataset. The cleaning steps involved standardizing the data formats, converting the SaleDate to the correct date format, separating the Address into individual components, filling in null and blank values using data from corresponding rows, and removing any duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.

- **Skills:** Converting Data Types, SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, CASE WHEN, Joins, CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions.

- **Technology:** SQL Server

- **Results:** The cleaned dataset is now ready for analysis, providing a reliable foundation for future exploratory data analysis and insights into Nashville's housing market. This cleaning process enhances data quality and ensures that any subsequent analyses will be based on accurate and consistent information.
