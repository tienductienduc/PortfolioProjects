I have a basic understanding of Python, allowing me to perform fundamental tasks such as data manipulation, simple automation, and basic data visualization. I am gettine familiar with libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib, and I'm eager to deepen my knowledge and skills in Python for data analysis and automation tasks.

#### Movie Industries
**Direct:** [Movie Industries](https://github.com/tienductienduc/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/PYTHON)

- **Goal:** To analyze a comprehensive dataset of movies from around the world, focusing on key characteristics such as ratings, box office performance, and profitability.

- **Description:** In this project, I utilized Python to process a dataset containing various movie details. The analysis involved formatting the data, removing null and blank values, and filtering for target values. I created regression plots to explore correlations between different characteristics and generated charts to visualize the top movies of all time based on gross and profit.

- **Skills:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, data cleaning, data types converting

- **Technology:** Python.

- **Results:** The analysis will provide insights into the factors contributing to a movie's success, revealing patterns in ratings, profitability, and audience engagement. The visualizations created will help identify the highest-grossing films and support data-driven discussions about trends in the film industry.
