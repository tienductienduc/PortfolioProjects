I have a foundational understanding of SQL, enabling me to write queries for data extraction and basic manipulation. While Iâ€™m still expanding my skills, I can perform tasks such as writing some complex queries to join tables, filter datasets, and perform aggregations, allowing me to derive actionable insights from medium, to large datasets. I'm eager to enhance my SQL expertise further to support data-driven decision-making.

**Direct:** [World Layoffs Project](https://github.com/tienductienduc/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/SQL/MYSQL)

- **Goal:** To analyze global layoffs trends from March 2020 to March 2023 across various industries and countries. The project aims to identify patterns in layoffs over time, impacted industries, and countries with the highest layoff rates.

- **Description:** This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using MySQL, I processed a dataset containing company details, layoff dates, total laid-off employees, layoff percentages, industry types, and country information to explore layoff trends over time and across sectors.

- **Skills:** Converting Data Types, Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views.

- **Technology:** MySQL
  
- **Results:** Key insights reveal which countries and industries were most impacted by layoffs, peak layoff periods, and company-specific layoff rates. This analysis provides a data-driven understanding of global workforce reductions during this period, highlighting sectors and regions most affected by economic challenges.
