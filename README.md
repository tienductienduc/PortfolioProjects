# ðŸ‘‹ Tien Duc - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Tien Duc! I'm a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in Excel, SQL, and data visualization using Tableau and Power BI. I am passionate about uncovering insights and telling stories through data, leveraging these tools to make informed, data-driven decisions. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

My skills includes projects in:

- Data Analysis: From cleaning and organizing datasets in Excel to building dynamic, interactive dashboards in Excel, Tableau and Power BI.
- SQL Proficiency: Writing complex queries to extract, filter, and manipulate data, helping to uncover insights and support business needs.
- Python Basics: Some experience in using Python for data cleaning, simple automation, and visualization, aiming to grow further in this area.

I'm currently focused on expanding my technical skills with Python, and statistics skills while exploring opportunities in the data analysis. Feel free to explore my projects, where I've combined these skills to create impactful data solutions!

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will showcase data analytics projects, and solve real-world cases.

### Excel - Cleaning, Analysis, Visualisation

----------------------------------
#### Customer Feedback
**Direct:** [Customer Feedback](https://github.com/tienductienduc/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/EXCEL/_blank)

- **Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

- **Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

- **Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

- **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

- **Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

----------------------------------
#### Sales Dashboard
**Direct:** [Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/tienductienduc/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/EXCEL)

- **Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

- **Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

- **Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

- **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

- **Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.
